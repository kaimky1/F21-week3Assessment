            Hi! My name is Kai and I'm an aspiring Fullstack Developer interested in creating applications for people in the education industry. After realizing that teaching was not for me, I started to dabble in coding. Although I am fairly new to the world of computer science and coding, I have a high expectations for myself to accomplish my goal of becoming a successful developer and impacting the world in a positive way through my creative lens. I found it absolutely wonderful how much of a creative and mind-boggling process coding was and wanted to learn more. I'm looking forward to building applications in a collaborative and creative environment.
